Material UI components are used such as the loader, and buttons.
The page renders the data from the API. It can handle various inputs to fetch the data, and The back button helps to navigate to the Search of subjects. Clear is used to remove the searched value in BookSearch. When the page is unable to fetch the data, it shows an alert to refresh the page. The buttons like back, previous, and next will be disabled on the conditions.There are two different loaders for two different API calls based on the load displayed on the required component.
